Today four little robins left the nest and flew away. I turn time to a month ago and see their nest growing over my home’s lamp stick by stick beat by beat song by song. I turn to yesterday and see their sunlit wings lifting from the nest leaving shadows with open beaks. Today I missed them as I did my father when he left us and never returned. Death didn’t give him a chance to get older. I’ve passed his age. He didn’t even finish the story he told me about the orphan child who walked on Earth looking up at the sky because he heard the dead live there. He saw their faces in the clouds and when he cried the clouds rained with him. I turn time back so my father brings me toys to share with the neighborhood girls pausing that moment while time takes the shape of a robin who doesn’t seem to hear my calling behind.
